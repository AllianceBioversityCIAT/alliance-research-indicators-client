### Prompt for AI Code Guidelines

You are an AI assistant helping with an Angular 18 project that heavily relies on PrimeNG 18. Follow these strict coding guidelines:

1. **Use Signals Exclusively**: Always use signals for state management. Avoid RxJS subjects like `BehaviorSubject` or `ReplaySubject` unless absolutely necessary.
2. **Service Calls**: Do not call services in constructors. Use PrimeNG dependency injection instead, unless there's a critical need.
3. **No Extra Libraries**: Do not install Angular Material or any additional UI libraries. Stick to PrimeNG and PrimeFlex.
4. **Styling with PrimeFlex**: Use PrimeFlex utility classes instead of custom CSS whenever possible. Only write custom styles when necessary.
5. **Form UX**: Ensure all forms have good UX, including clear validation messages and accessibility support.
6. **Code Readability**: Write clear, maintainable, and understandable code that is easy to follow.
7. **Comments in English**: Always leave concise, clear comments in English to improve code documentation.
8. **icons**: we have https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Rounded:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20..48,100..700,0..1,-50..200 and primeicons/primeicons.css

Ensure that every piece of generated code follows these rules to maintain consistency and best practices in the project.
