# Open Questions for BA / Backend — Bilateral Module / Indicator Mapping

> **Audience**: BA, backend dev, designer (if available), **PO** (now needed for OQ-IM-1).
> **Purpose**: surface three product / technical decisions that block ~75% of the indicator-mapping (US3 + US4) implementation. Until these are answered, no further code can land beyond the four small pieces already shipped.
> **Read time**: 5–10 minutes (or 20 if you also read §6 backend audit + §7 backend reply).
> **Status**: requested 2026-05-24 · §6 FE-side backend code audit 2026-05-26 · **§7 backend reply received 2026-05-26** — OQ-IM-3 + 2 bonuses **ACCEPTED** (can ship in ~1 day after BA confirms seed/taxonomy); `is_stale` bonus already shipped; **OQ-IM-1 escalated to PO** (overturns R-BIL-031 + D5 + D12); **OQ-IM-2 escalated to BA** (3 sub-questions on AOW source/cardinality). Backend on `AC-1594-bilateral-module-v2`, snapshot at [`../ari-backend-context/backend-response-to-fe.md`](../ari-backend-context/backend-response-to-fe.md).

## TL;DR

Three open questions block the indicator-mapping work. The **mockups under `docs/specs/bilateral-module/figma-mockups/` and the backend handoff `docs/specs/bilateral-module/ari-backend-context/frontend-handoff.md` disagree on three points**. The FE is built mockup-first per the project rule that the Figma file is canonical for UX — but each disagreement maps to a concrete backend decision the BA + backend team need to make together. Picking either side per question is fine; what we need is a decision.

| OQ | What needs to be decided | Who decides | Unblocks | FE recommendation (post §6 audit) | Backend reply (post §7) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OQ-IM-1** | Contribution body shape on the `POST/PATCH /contribution` endpoint | **PO** (now — escalated) | 5 FE tasks | **Path A** — simplify to `{ reason_code, quantitative_contribution_value? }`; deprecate 5 polymorphic handlers | **DEFERRED — PO must retire R-BIL-031 + D5 + D12.** Backend agrees Path A is cleanest engineering but won't act without PO sign-off. |
| **OQ-IM-2** | Where does the **Area of Work (AOW)** grouping come from? | **BA** (now — escalated) | 3 FE tasks | **Path A** — backend adds `area_of_work` entity + nest in `IndicatorGroupResponse` | **DEFERRED — BA must answer 3 sub-questions**: (a) is AOW a real CGIAR ToC taxonomy level?, (b) source = CLARISA / PRMS / manual seed / admin?, (c) cardinality = 1:1 or many-to-many? |
| **OQ-IM-3** | Does `GET .../contribution?lever-code=` exist for edit-mode pre-fill? | Backend | 2 FE tasks | **Path A** — backend adds the GET endpoint | **ACCEPTED.** ~½ day to ship; can land bundled with bonuses on `AC-1594-bilateral-module-v2`. Response body shape couples to OQ-IM-1's outcome. |
| **Bonus** `is_quantitative` | Add `is_quantitative: boolean` on `indicator` entity | Backend + BA | OQ-IM-6, REQ-BIL-IM-10 | Add as part of safe bundle | **ACCEPTED.** ~½ day. Needs BA seed list of quantitative indicator codes. |
| **Bonus** `disabled_reason` | Add `disabled_reason: string \| null` on panel response | Backend + BA/FE | OQ-IM-9, REQ-BIL-IM-04 | Add as part of safe bundle | **ACCEPTED.** ~½ day. Needs BA/FE alignment on reason taxonomy; backend proposes 2 default rules. |
| **Bonus** `is_stale` on panel | Surface existing `is_stale` flag on panel response | Backend | REQ-BIL-IM-04 / -18 | Add as part of safe bundle | **ALREADY SHIPPED** at `dto/list-indicators-query.dto.ts:29`. Our audit was stale on this one. |

The proposal that produced this work is [`../proposal.md`](../proposal.md). The mockup-first FE design that ran into these gates is [`./design.md`](./design.md). The full requirements list is [`./requirements.md`](./requirements.md). Visual references live under [`../figma-mockups/`](../figma-mockups/).

## 0. Context — what we're building

A Researcher / PI working on a bilateral (W3/CGIAR-funded) result needs to:

1. Declare whether the result contributes to Pool Funding (Yes/No) and pick the Science Programs / Accelerators it contributes to → **already shipped** in the Pool Funding Alignment section (US2).
2. **Map the result to specific High-Level Outputs (HLOs) under those Science Programs**, and record the contribution detail (this spec — US3 + US4).

The mockup-driven flow:

1. User picks SPs → an "AI card" appears with **"VIEW HIGH LEVEL OUTPUTS"** + CTA → opens the **HLO selection modal**.
2. Modal is a **tree picker**: left sidebar lists SPs expanded into **Areas of Work**; right pane shows indicators per active AOW with checkboxes; footer counter + Confirm/Cancel.
3. On confirm, the modal closes and the selected indicators render as **inline cards** on the main alignment form, grouped **SP → AOW → HLO**.
4. Each card has: indicator name + code, status tag, progress bar, **Expected target** (read-only), **Quantitative contribution** (conditional dropdown), **Why is this being reported?** (required dropdown), × removal.
5. On the alignment form's existing **Save** button, the FE diffs persisted vs pending mappings and fires sequential `DELETE → POST → PATCH` per `(indicator_code, lever_code)` pair.

That's the canonical mockup flow. The questions below are about how it should hit the backend.

---

## 1. OQ-IM-1 — Contribution body shape (headline question)

### The conflict

**Mockup card** ([`figma-mockups/33356-11075-pool-funding-alignment-filled-empty-reason.md`](../figma-mockups/33356-11075-pool-funding-alignment-filled-empty-reason.md), [`figma-mockups/32472-129409-pool-funding-alignment-filled-with-quantitative.md`](../figma-mockups/32472-129409-pool-funding-alignment-filled-with-quantitative.md)) shows three user-editable fields per HLO mapping:

| Field | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Expected target** | Read-only. Comes from the catalog (e.g., `20 - NUMBER OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTS`). |
| **Quantitative contribution** | Conditional dropdown. Only renders when the indicator's `is_quantitative` flag is true. |
| **Why is this being reported?** | Required dropdown. Free taxonomy (TBD per OQ-IM-4). |

**Backend handoff** ([`ari-backend-context/frontend-handoff.md` §7](../ari-backend-context/frontend-handoff.md#7-type-specific-contribution-payloads-d12)) specifies **5 polymorphic payloads** keyed by `indicator_type`, each with totally different fields:

| `indicator_type` | Fields (verbatim — D12 typos intentional) |
|---|---|
| `capacity_sharing` | `women`, `men`, `non_binary`, `has_unkown_using`, `capdev_term_id`, `capdev_delivery_method_id` |
| `knowledge_product` | `handle`, `knowledge_product_type`, `licence`, `peer_reviewed`, `is_isi`, `accessibility` |
| `policy_change` | `policy_type_id`, `policy_stage_id`, `implementing_organizations[]`, `amount?` |
| `innovation_development` | `innovation_typology: { code }`, `innovation_developers`, `readinness_level_id` |
| `NOOP` | `narrative` (free text) |

**These two specifications don't overlap.** The mockup shows 3 fields; the handoff shows 5 different per-type structures with up to 6 fields each. They describe two different products.

### Why this question matters

It determines:
- What the FE sends in the body of `POST/PATCH /pool-funding-alignment/indicators/:indicatorCode/contribution`.
- Whether the FE needs **5 polymorphic form variants** or **1 unified form**.
- Whether the existing backend handler code under `entities/bilateral/handlers/` (referenced by the handoff) gets used as-is, modified, or deprecated.

### Resolution options

| Path | What it means | FE impact | Backend impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(A) Mockups supersede; backend simplifies the body** | The POST/PATCH body becomes the mockup's 3 fields: `{ quantitative_contribution?: number, reason_code: string }` (Expected target is catalog-sourced, not in the body). The 5 polymorphic handlers become dead code or get deferred. | 1 unified form. Less FE complexity. | New simplified body schema; old handlers retired or repurposed. |
| **(B) Mockup card is a wrapper; clicking "Details" opens a polymorphic sub-form** | The mockup's 3 fields are the "summary" view; a deeper button (not in current mockups) opens the 5-type form. | 1 unified summary form + 5 polymorphic sub-forms (more work). | No backend changes; existing handlers stay. |
| **(C) The mockup card IS one of the 5 types — probably `NOOP`** | Reason maps to `narrative`. Quantitative contribution goes into a custom field. The other 4 types are deferred. | 1 form variant (NOOP only) for now; deferred work for the other 4. | No backend changes; only NOOP handler is exercised in v1. |
| **(D) Hybrid: keep the polymorphic body BUT extend it with the mockup's 3 fields** | Body is `{ indicator_type, ...polymorphic-fields, quantitative_contribution?, reason_code }`. Both shapes coexist. | 5 form variants + the 3 mockup fields rendered on every one. | Backend handlers extended to accept + store the new fields. |

### Frontend recommendation

**Option (A)** is the cleanest match to what the mockups actually depict and what reviewers will see in production. The 5 polymorphic types in the handoff predate the mockup set (mockups dated 2026-05-15); they may have been an early backend design that no longer reflects the product intent. **If (A) is wrong**, we need the BA to confirm where the deeper per-type form fits in the user journey — the mockups currently don't show one.

### Impact on the FE if undecided

Five tasks (T-BIL-IM-01, -04, -08, -09, -11) remain `pending — GATED on OQ-IM-1`. The `bodyOf(mapping)` mapper in `BilateralService.saveMappings`, the HLO card's editable fields, and the form-validation logic all depend on this decision.

---

## 2. OQ-IM-2 — AOW (Area of Work) data source

### The conflict

**Mockup** ([`figma-mockups/32471-131617-hlo-modal-empty.md`](../figma-mockups/32471-131617-hlo-modal-empty.md), [`figma-mockups/33356-11075-pool-funding-alignment-filled-empty-reason.md`](../figma-mockups/33356-11075-pool-funding-alignment-filled-empty-reason.md)) groups indicators in a **3-level hierarchy**: SP → **AOW** → HLO. AOW examples from the mockup:

- `SP01 - Breeding for Tomorrow`
  - `AOW01 - Market Intelligence`
  - `AOW02 - …`
- `SP02 - Sustainable Farming`
  - `AOW03 - Resilient Soils`
  - …

**Backend handoff** ([`ari-backend-context/frontend-handoff.md` §4.4](../ari-backend-context/frontend-handoff.md#44-get-indicators-panel)) returns `IndicatorGroupResponse[]` grouped **by `lever_code` (SP) only** — no AOW layer:

```ts
{
  lever_code: string;
  lever_name: string;
  indicators: { indicator_code, indicator_name, indicator_type, ... }[];
}[]
```

The mockup README ([`figma-mockups/README.md` §7](../figma-mockups/README.md) OQ-FIG-3) also raises this and asks for BA confirmation on whether AOW is a real taxonomy level.

### Why this question matters

The mockup's modal sidebar IS the SP/AOW tree — that's the primary navigation inside the picker. Without AOW data, the sidebar can't render the mockup's design.

### Resolution options

| Path | What it means | FE impact | Backend impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(A) Backend extends the response to include AOW nesting** | `IndicatorGroupResponse` becomes `{ lever_code, lever_name, areas_of_work: { aow_code, aow_name, indicators: [] }[] }`. | FE renders the tree directly. | One-time response-shape extension on `GET .../indicators`. |
| **(B) FE infers AOW from `indicator_code` prefix convention** | E.g., `CR-HL01-001` → `HL01`. Fragile (depends on stable code conventions). | FE does client-side regrouping. | No change. |
| **(C) Separate `GET .../areas-of-work` endpoint** | FE fetches AOW catalog separately + joins client-side via a foreign key on `IndicatorRow`. | More requests, more state. | New endpoint. |
| **(D) Drop AOW from v1 — flatten to SP → HLO only** | Mockup tree simplifies to 2 levels. AOWs absent until catalog stabilizes. | Mockup divergence. Requires designer sign-off. | No change. |

### Frontend recommendation

**Option (A)** — backend extends the response. AOW is a stable taxonomy concept in CGIAR ToC (well-known to PRMS / CLARISA), so adding it to the response is a small, durable backend change. (B) is fragile; (C) doubles request count; (D) creates a visible mockup mismatch.

### Impact on the FE if undecided

Three tasks (T-BIL-IM-01 type, T-BIL-IM-05 modal sidebar, T-BIL-IM-10 inline-card grouping) are gated.

---

## 3. OQ-IM-3 — Edit-mode pre-fill (GET contribution endpoint)

### The conflict

When the user opens an already-mapped HLO card to edit (Reason / Quantitative), the FE needs the existing contribution body to pre-fill the form. Two ways to source it:

**Primary path** (assumed in the FE design): `GET /pool-funding-alignment/indicators/:indicatorCode/contribution?lever-code=…` returns the existing body. This endpoint is **not currently documented** in the handoff.

**Fallback**: extend the panel `GET .../indicators` to include each indicator's existing contribution body inline (`indicator.contribution?: ContributionBody`).

### Why this question matters

Without one of these, edit-mode pre-fill is impossible. The FE could fall back to "always create new" (DELETE + POST instead of PATCH), but that loses the audit trail and is server-incompatible.

### Resolution options

| Path | What it means | FE impact | Backend impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(A) Backend adds `GET .../contribution`** | Modal opens → fetch per-indicator body → seed form. Smaller responses on the panel GET. | One extra GET per Edit click. | One new endpoint. |
| **(B) Backend embeds contribution body in the panel GET** | `IndicatorRow.contribution?: ContributionBody`. No extra GET. | Larger panel responses; FE seeds from row data. | One-line response extension. |
| **(C) FE only supports create / delete; no edit** | Every modification is "remove + re-add". | Loses Reason history; awkward UX. | No change. Worst option. |

### Frontend recommendation

**Either (A) or (B)** — both work. (A) is cleaner (panel GET stays light); (B) is faster (fewer requests). Pick whichever the backend team prefers. (C) is not acceptable.

### Impact on the FE if undecided

Two tasks (T-BIL-IM-04 `getContribution` service method, T-BIL-IM-08 HLO card edit-mode pre-fill) are gated.

---

## 4. Non-gating open questions (decide during design, not blocking)

These don't block tasks but the BA should weigh in eventually.

- **OQ-IM-4** — Source of the "Why is this being reported?" dropdown option list. Per-indicator from the catalog, or a fixed CLARISA taxonomy?
- **OQ-IM-5** — Source of the "Quantitative contribution" dropdown option list. Per-indicator from the catalog (likely — since units differ per indicator).
- **OQ-IM-6** — Where does the `is_quantitative` flag live on the indicator? (Mockup `32472:129409` implies it's a per-indicator field; we need the field name.)
- **OQ-IM-7** — When mappings already exist, does the AI card collapse to a thin "Manage HLO mappings" link, or stay as a full card? *(Design intent.)*
- **OQ-IM-9** — Where does the **disabled-indicator reason text** come from? Per the mockup `33563:138613`, each disabled row has a different reason; that means the backend needs to expose a per-row `disabled_reason: string | null`.
- **OQ-FIG-5** — The mockup CTA button says `Upload file` (likely a copy-paste artifact). We're using `View HLOs` in code. Confirm the final copy.

---

## 5. How to respond

For each of OQ-IM-1, -2, -3, the BA + backend dev together should pick one of the labeled options (A/B/C/D) and write a one-sentence rationale. Capture the decision by editing [`./requirements.md` §12 "Open questions"](./requirements.md#12-assumptions--open-questions) directly, OR replying in whatever channel the team uses (Slack / Jira AC-1594 thread / etc.) and we'll fold the answer into the spec.

Once all three are answered, the FE can start T-BIL-IM-01 (backend verification + interfaces + 5 ApiService methods) which unblocks the rest of the chain. ETA from "OQs answered" to "indicator-mapping shipped end-to-end" is roughly **10–14 working days** of FE work (11 sequential tasks; some can parallelize) plus whatever backend changes the chosen options require.

---

## 6. Backend code findings — 2026-05-26 (FE-side audit + recommendations)

> **Update — 2026-05-26.** Two days after sending this brief, the FE team ran a direct audit of the **ARI backend repo** (`alliance-research-indicators-main/server/researchindicators/src/domain/entities/bilateral/`, branch `AC-1594-bilateral-module`) to ground the three Open Questions in actual code rather than the snapshot frontend-handoff (which is dated 2026-05-19, ~1 week old). The findings sharpen the conflict and reveal **three real backend modeling gaps** beyond what's described in the snapshot. Posted here so the BA + backend team can react with full context.

### 6.0 Method

Read-only audit of the bilateral entity tree on `AC-1594-bilateral-module`. No code modified. Specific files inspected:

- `bilateral.controller.ts` — route registration
- `bilateral.service.ts` — service-layer logic, handler dispatch, `listIndicators`
- `dto/upsert-indicator-mapping.dto.ts` — request/response DTOs
- `dto/list-indicators-query.dto.ts` — panel-GET response shape
- `handlers/{capacity-sharing,knowledge-product,policy-change,innovation-development,noop}.handler.ts` — per-type handlers
- `handlers/bilateral-indicator-type-handler.interface.ts` — handler contract
- `entities/result-pool-funding-indicator-mapping.entity.ts` — TypeORM entity for stored mappings
- `entities/indicator.entity.ts` — indicator catalog row shape
- `src/domain/tools/socket/server.gateway.ts` — socket event emitter

### 6.1 OQ-IM-1 — Contribution body shape — findings

**What the backend actually says today:**

| Surface | Today | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `POST/PATCH /pool-funding-alignment/indicators/:indicatorCode/contribution` accepts | `ContributionDto = { indicator_type, type, [key: string]: unknown }` — **fully open polymorphic** | `bilateral.controller.ts:171-244` + `dto/upsert-indicator-mapping.dto.ts:3-11` |
| Dispatch by `indicator_type` | Yes — 5 handlers registered in `bilateral.service.ts:76-80` and dispatched in `getContributionHandler()` | `bilateral.service.ts` |
| `capacity_sharing` required fields | `women, men, non_binary, has_unkown_using, capdev_term_id, capdev_delivery_method_id` | `handlers/capacity-sharing.handler.ts:25-33` |
| `knowledge_product` required fields | `handle, knowledge_product_type, licence, peer_reviewed, is_isi, accessibility` | `handlers/knowledge-product.handler.ts:24-32` |
| `policy_change` required fields | `policy_type_id, policy_stage_id, implementing_organizations[]` (`amount?` optional) | `handlers/policy-change.handler.ts:24-36` |
| `innovation_development` required fields | `innovation_typology.code, innovation_developers, readinness_level_id` | `handlers/innovation-development.handler.ts:24-38` |
| `NOOP` required fields | `narrative` (free text) | `handlers/noop.handler.ts:14-17` |
| Stored mapping entity columns | type-specific FKs (`result_capacity_sharing_id`, `result_knowledge_product_id`, `result_policy_change_id`, `result_innovation_dev_id`) + `other_contribution_narrative` (NOOP) | `entities/result-pool-funding-indicator-mapping.entity.ts:17-135` |
| `reason_code` column on the mapping entity | **NOT present** | (absence) |
| `quantitative_contribution` column on the mapping entity | **NOT present** | (absence) |

**Bottom line**: the snapshot handoff §7 is current. The 5 polymorphic handlers are alive and the entity stores type-specific FK relations. The mockup's 3-field shape (`Expected target` read-only / `Quantitative contribution` / `Why is this being reported?`) **maps to nothing in the current backend** — it's not a simplification of the current shape, it's a different model. No NOOP-only shortcut: NOOP's only field is `narrative`, which doesn't carry a `quantitative_contribution` value.

**FE recommendation — Path (A) "Mockups supersede; backend simplifies"**

- Add columns to `ResultPoolFundingIndicatorMapping`: `reason_code: string` (NOT NULL) and `quantitative_contribution_value: number | null` (NULL allowed; only set when `is_quantitative=true` on the indicator).
- Reshape POST/PATCH body to `{ reason_code: string, quantitative_contribution_value?: number }`. `indicator_type` becomes a discriminator the backend already infers from the indicator catalog (not user input).
- The 5 polymorphic handlers + their per-type tables (`result_capacity_sharing`, `result_knowledge_product`, etc.) are **deferred or deprecated** in v1. They can stay in code as dead branches and be removed later, OR be repurposed for a future "Details" sub-form (which isn't in the mockups today).
- Rationale: the mockups went through the design QA cycle and represent the current product intent. The 5-type model predates them (it's an early backend design from before the mockup set was approved on 2026-05-15). One unified form per HLO card is what users will see and what reviewers will approve. The per-type richness can come back later as a deeper drill-down if the business reverses, but it doesn't need to ship in US3/US4.

**Backend implications (Path A)**

- ~1 migration: `ALTER TABLE result_pool_funding_indicator_mapping ADD COLUMN reason_code VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'unspecified'`; `ADD COLUMN quantitative_contribution_value NUMERIC NULL`.
- `ContributionDto` simplifies to `{ reason_code, quantitative_contribution_value? }`.
- The 5 handlers can be replaced by one method that writes the two new columns directly. **OR** keep the handlers + treat them as inert (the controller stops invoking the per-type ones).
- Validation moves from "type-specific required fields" to "`reason_code` must be in the reason taxonomy"; the taxonomy itself is OQ-IM-4 (still non-gating but needs the BA to pick a source).
- No data migration required if v1 ships before any production data exists. If production already has rows, the new `reason_code` column needs a backfill — defer the decision to the migration PR.

### 6.2 OQ-IM-2 — AOW (Area of Work) data source — findings

**What the backend actually says today:**

| Surface | Today | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /pool-funding-alignment/indicators` response shape | `IndicatorGroupResponse[] = { lever_code, lever_name, indicators[] }` — **no AOW layer** | `bilateral.service.ts:369-404` + `dto/list-indicators-query.dto.ts:32-36` |
| Any `area_of_work` / `aow` / `AreaOfWork` entity, table, or column | **Zero references** anywhere under `src/domain/` | `grep -r "area.of.work\|area_of_work\|aow\|AreaOfWork" src/domain` returned no matches |
| Any FK on indicator → AOW | **Not present** | `entities/indicator.entity.ts` has no AOW reference |
| Separate `GET /areas-of-work` endpoint | **Does not exist** | controller search |
| `indicator_code` prefix convention | Not enforced as a parsable identifier in code | (inspected the entity; codes are opaque strings) |

**Bottom line**: AOW is **genuinely unmodeled** in the backend. There is no field to read, no convention to parse, no FK to join on. The mockup's three-level tree (SP → AOW → HLO) cannot render today regardless of FE work.

**FE recommendation — Path (A) "Backend extends the response to include AOW nesting"**

- Add an `area_of_work` entity + `area_of_work` table with at minimum: `aow_code: string PK, aow_name: string, lever_code: string FK → levers`.
- Add `aow_code: string FK NOT NULL` on the `indicator` entity (or a junction `indicator_area_of_work` if an indicator can span AOWs — the BA needs to confirm whether this is many-to-one or many-to-many).
- Extend `IndicatorGroupResponse` to nest: `{ lever_code, lever_name, areas_of_work: { aow_code, aow_name, indicators: [] }[] }`.
- AOW is a stable CGIAR ToC concept (PRMS / CLARISA already model it), so the entity should align with whatever upstream source it comes from — confirm during the backend implementation PR. PRD C-3 (CLARISA-owned vocabularies) likely applies.
- Rationale: AOW is the modal's primary navigation. Without it, the SP → AOW → HLO sidebar can't render; flattening to SP → HLO (Path D) would require designer sign-off and would diverge visibly from the approved mockup. (B) — code-prefix inference — is fragile (the FE would silently break on any indicator code that doesn't match the convention, including legacy data). (C) — separate AOW endpoint — doubles request count without benefit.

**Backend implications (Path A)**

- 1 migration for the new entity + FK on `indicator`.
- 1 service change: `listIndicators` groups by `(lever_code, aow_code)` instead of just `lever_code`.
- 1 DTO change: `IndicatorGroupResponse` response shape.
- 1 ingestion question (NOT this PR's concern): where do the AOW rows themselves come from? CLARISA sync? Manual seed? PRMS pull? — surface for the BA to answer when scheduling the migration.

### 6.3 OQ-IM-3 — Edit-mode pre-fill (GET contribution endpoint) — findings

**What the backend actually says today:**

| Surface | Today | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /pool-funding-alignment/indicators/:indicatorCode/contribution?lever-code=` route | **Does not exist** | `bilateral.controller.ts` — no `@Get('indicators/:indicatorCode/contribution')` |
| Panel-GET `IndicatorPanelIndicatorResponse` shape | `{ indicator_code, indicator_name, indicator_type, target_description, is_active, is_mapped, is_stale }` — no `contribution` field | `dto/list-indicators-query.dto.ts:22-30` |
| `MappingResponse` returned on POST/PATCH | `{ result_code, lever_code, lever_name, indicator_code, indicator_type, is_stale }` — no contribution body | `dto/upsert-indicator-mapping.dto.ts:13-20` |
| Any service method returning a single contribution | **Not present** | searched `bilateral.service.ts` |

**Bottom line**: no GET endpoint, no embedded body. Edit-mode pre-fill is impossible today.

**FE recommendation — Path (A) "Backend adds GET .../contribution"**

- Add a `GET /pool-funding-alignment/indicators/:indicatorCode/contribution?lever-code=...` route returning the stored contribution body in the same shape the POST/PATCH body uses (post §7.1 simplification: `{ reason_code, quantitative_contribution_value? }`).
- Cheapest backend work of all three OQs — a single repository `findOne` + a thin DTO denormalize + a controller route. No new migration.
- Rationale: keeps the panel-GET response light (it stays the catalog-listing endpoint). The contribution body only needs to be fetched when the user clicks edit on an HLO card — lazy is good.

**Backend implications (Path A)**

- 1 new route + 1 new service method + 1 new DTO (`ContributionResponse`, identical to the simplified `ContributionDto`).
- No migration. No data change. Lowest-risk of the three.

### 6.4 Bonus discoveries (related backend gaps)

While auditing the entities, the FE found three additional fields the mockup relies on that don't exist in the backend today. Flagging here for the BA + backend team to incorporate into the same backend PR as OQ-IM-1's simplification:

| Mockup field | Backend status | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| `is_quantitative: boolean` on indicator (drives conditional rendering of the Quantitative dropdown — OQ-IM-6) | **Not on `indicator.entity.ts`** | Add `is_quantitative: boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false` to the `indicator` table. Source of truth: the indicator catalog (when it ships via the ToC sync — currently empty). |
| `disabled_reason: string \| null` on `IndicatorPanelIndicatorResponse` (drives the inline "this indicator cannot be mapped because…" callout — OQ-IM-9) | **Not on the response DTO** | Add a per-row `disabled_reason: string \| null` to `IndicatorPanelIndicatorResponse`. Server-side validation computes it (e.g., "already mapped to a sibling result", "stale"). Client renders verbatim. |
| `is_stale: boolean` on indicator | ✅ Present on `ResultPoolFundingIndicatorMapping:93-99` but NOT on `IndicatorPanelIndicatorResponse` | Surface `is_stale` on the panel response DTO too, so the modal can show the stale-disabled treatment without needing a second fetch. |

The socket event `result.pool-funding-alignment.changed` was confirmed live in `src/domain/tools/socket/server.gateway.ts:11-12`. No gap there.

### 6.5 Summary table — what we're asking from the backend team

| OQ | FE recommended path | Backend work required | Effort estimate (rough) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OQ-IM-1** | (A) Simplify contribution body to `{ reason_code, quantitative_contribution_value? }`; deprecate per-type handlers | 1 migration (2 columns on `result_pool_funding_indicator_mapping`) + DTO + service + controller updates; tests | M (2–3 days) |
| **OQ-IM-2** | (A) Add `area_of_work` entity + nest in `IndicatorGroupResponse` | 1 migration (new table + FK on indicator) + service grouping + DTO; ingestion source TBD | M–L (3–5 days; depends on AOW seed source) |
| **OQ-IM-3** | (A) Add `GET .../contribution?lever-code=` route | 1 service method + 1 controller route + 1 DTO; no migration | S (½ day) |
| **Bonus** | Add `is_quantitative` + `disabled_reason` + `is_stale` on panel response | 1 migration (`is_quantitative` on indicator) + DTO updates + computed-property logic for `disabled_reason` | S (½–1 day) |

Total: ~6–10 backend-dev days. FE work resumes the day OQ-IM-1's reason_code shape is locked (T-BIL-IM-01 backend-verification + interfaces can land that same day in parallel with the migration).

### 6.6 How the BA / backend should respond

Two equivalent paths to capture the decision — either is fine:

1. **In-spec**: edit [`./requirements.md` §12 "Open questions"](./requirements.md#12-assumptions--open-questions) directly. Replace each `OQ-IM-1/2/3` block with `RESOLVED — Path X — <one-sentence rationale>`.
2. **Out-of-spec**: reply via the AC-1594 Jira thread / Slack channel with the per-OQ decision. The FE folds the answer into `./requirements.md` §12 in the same PR that picks up the work.

Once **OQ-IM-1 is locked**, the FE can start T-BIL-IM-01 (backend verification + interfaces + 5 ApiService methods) on the day the backend migration PR opens — they don't need to wait for the migration to merge. Lock OQ-IM-2 and -3 together with -1 ideally; if -1 is decided first, the FE will start and pause again at T-BIL-IM-05 (modal sidebar) which depends on -2.

## 7. Backend reply — 2026-05-26 (received)

> **Update — 2026-05-26 (late afternoon).** Backend team replied to §6 the same day with a structured doc on their side (`alliance-research-indicators-main/docs/specs/bilateral-module/indicator-mapping/backend-response-to-fe.md`, commit `cfbeb8ec`, branch `AC-1594-bilateral-module-v2`). The full text is snapshotted in our repo at [`../ari-backend-context/backend-response-to-fe.md`](../ari-backend-context/backend-response-to-fe.md). This section is a STAR-side summary of what changed and what we now own to follow up on.

### 7.1 Backend's verdict per OQ

- **OQ-IM-1 — DEFERRED to PO.** Backend agrees Path A is the cleanest engineering call, but Path A overturns three approved spec items on the backend side: **R-BIL-031** ("Capture type-specific contribution payload"), **D5** (innovation_use decision), and **D12** (preserve backend-compatible typos). Backend cannot retire these without explicit PO sign-off, because doing so would break the audit trail to AC-1440 + risk losing the per-type tables (`result_capacity_sharing`, `result_knowledge_product`, …) that other platform surfaces (search, OpenSearch decorators, the future PRMS push payload in R-BIL-041) may consume.
- **OQ-IM-2 — DEFERRED to BA.** Backend agrees Path A is the right engineering call but needs three answers from BA before implementing: (1) is AOW a real CGIAR ToC taxonomy level?, (2) where do AOW rows originate (CLARISA / PRMS / manual seed / admin-maintained)?, (3) is indicator↔AOW 1:1 (FK on indicator) or many-to-many (junction table)? Cardinality dictates schema; source dictates ingestion pipeline. Estimate after sign-off: M–L (~3–5 days).
- **OQ-IM-3 — ACCEPTED.** Backend ships `GET /pool-funding-alignment/indicators/:indicatorCode/contribution?lever-code=` as a thin additive change (~½ day; controller + service + DTO + sibling spec + Swagger). Auth: ROAR JWT only — no `RolesGuard` / `ResultOwnerGuard` since it's a read. Response shape couples to OQ-IM-1's outcome: ships as the current polymorphic shape if OQ-IM-1 hasn't resolved, updates in the same PR as OQ-IM-1's simplification if/when Path A is approved.
- **Bonus `is_quantitative`** — ACCEPTED. ~½ day. Backend needs BA's seed list (which `indicator_code` values are quantitative). Without it, the default is `false` for every indicator and the FE conditional dropdown never renders.
- **Bonus `disabled_reason`** — ACCEPTED. ~½ day. Backend proposes 2 default rules: `null` when not disabled; `"Indicator is no longer active in the catalog"` when `is_active=false`; `"Already mapped to a sibling result version"` when there's an active mapping on a different version. BA / FE can extend or rewrite the taxonomy. (See §7.4 below for STAR's response.)
- **Bonus `is_stale` on panel** — **ALREADY SHIPPED.** `IndicatorPanelIndicatorResponse.is_stale: boolean` exists at `dto/list-indicators-query.dto.ts:29` and is populated by `BilateralService.listIndicators`. The §6 audit was stale on this one — landed in a wave between the FE snapshot date and 2026-05-26. **FE can start consuming `is_stale` immediately** (no T-BIL-IM-01 typing work needed beyond declaring the field on `IndicatorRow`).

### 7.2 New gating: OQ-IM-4 reclassified

Backend reclassified **OQ-IM-4** ("reason taxonomy source") from "non-gating but BA should weigh in" → **gating-once-OQ-IM-1-Path-A-is-approved**. Reasoning: validation needs a finite set of values; backend can't validate `reason_code` without a defined enum. Backend proposed a provisional default of `direct_contribution | aligned_with | reference_only | other`. The FE should weigh in once the UX is settled (see §7.4).

### 7.3 What the safe bundle unblocks on the FE side

Once the backend's safe bundle (OQ-IM-3 + `is_quantitative` + `disabled_reason`) ships, the FE gains:

- **Edit-mode pre-fill** is enabled — T-BIL-IM-04's `getContribution` service method + T-BIL-IM-08's HLO-card pre-fill have an endpoint to call. Wiring is straightforward but the **body shape is still gated on OQ-IM-1** — until that settles, the FE either implements the polymorphic shape inversion or waits.
- **`is_quantitative` flag** unblocks the conditional Quantitative-contribution row on the HLO card (T-BIL-IM-09 / REQ-BIL-IM-10) — but only when the seed list is populated. Until then, every indicator renders without the row, which is a graceful fallback.
- **`disabled_reason`** unblocks the disabled-indicator callout (T-BIL-IM-06 / REQ-BIL-IM-04). The FE consumes the field verbatim and renders it as a callout — server is the source of truth on the copy.
- **`is_stale`** unblocks REQ-BIL-IM-04 stale-disabled treatment and REQ-BIL-IM-18 (stale-but-mapped editable) — both can rely on the existing flag.

But **end-to-end shipping of US3/US4 is still gated on OQ-IM-1 + OQ-IM-2**. The safe bundle is necessary, not sufficient.

### 7.4 STAR's open follow-ups (where the FE has input)

The backend explicitly invited FE/BA input on three items. STAR's working positions:

| Item | STAR's working position | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| `disabled_reason` taxonomy defaults | **Backend's 2 default rules are good baseline copy.** Recommend adding two more: `"This indicator was retired in the upstream catalog. Existing mappings are preserved; new mappings are not accepted."` (stale-but-unmapped — matches REQ-BIL-IM-04 AC-04.4 canonical copy) AND `"This indicator is not available under the current Science Programs."` (for catalog-filter mismatch). BA can override. | High — matches existing FE spec. |
| `is_quantitative` seed list | **STAR doesn't have visibility into which indicators are quantitative** — that's a content / domain question. Defer to BA. Mockup `32472:129409` shows the row appearing on one indicator (`CR-HL01-001` family per the mockup); the BA list of which indicators carry the flag is the source of truth. | Low — BA owns this. |
| OQ-IM-4 reason taxonomy | **Backend's provisional `direct_contribution \| aligned_with \| reference_only \| other` is a reasonable starting point**, but the mockup language ("Why is this being reported?") suggests the dropdown should surface *human-meaningful reasons*, not technical contribution types. STAR recommends the BA confirm whether the dropdown is meant to capture (a) the *type of relationship* between the result and the HLO, or (b) the *reason this contribution counts* (deeper UX intent). If (b), the enum likely needs to be richer (e.g. `lead_contributor / supporting_contributor / capacity_building / advocacy / other`). | Medium — needs UX/BA discussion. |

### 7.5 Sequencing (what FE will do, when)

| State | FE action |
|---|---|
| **Today (post-reply)** | Update FE spec docs (this commit). Forward backend response + STAR follow-ups to PO/BA for sign-off on OQ-IM-1 + OQ-IM-2 + seed/taxonomy answers. |
| **Once backend ships safe bundle** (~1 day after BA confirms seed + taxonomy) | FE picks up T-BIL-IM-01 partial: type `is_stale` / `is_quantitative` / `disabled_reason` on `IndicatorRow`; add `GET_PoolFundingContribution` to ApiService. Doesn't unblock end-to-end but reduces hot-path work. |
| **Once OQ-IM-1 resolves** (PO sign-off + backend migration + simplified DTO) | FE resumes T-BIL-IM-01 fully → -04 → -08 → -09 → -11 chain. ~10–14 FE-dev days end-to-end. |
| **Once OQ-IM-2 resolves** (BA sign-off + backend AOW model) | FE resumes T-BIL-IM-05 (modal sidebar) + T-BIL-IM-10 (mount). |
| **Fallback after ~1 week if PO/BA stalls** | Per backend §6 paragraph 4: ship US3/US4 against the **current polymorphic shape** (suboptimal but unblocking); simplification becomes Phase 2 follow-up. Reopen the indicator-mapping spec to track the polymorphic path if we go this route. |

### 7.6 What's now external to engineering

Engineering on both sides is paused on three product/business decisions:

1. **PO** — retire (or re-affirm) R-BIL-031 + D5 + D12. **Owns OQ-IM-1.**
2. **BA** — answer the 3 AOW sub-questions (taxonomy / source / cardinality). **Owns OQ-IM-2.**
3. **BA** — provide the `is_quantitative` seed list + confirm `disabled_reason` taxonomy + answer OQ-IM-4 reason-dropdown intent. **Owns the safe-bundle preconditions and OQ-IM-4.**

The backend response template for capturing these decisions is documented in [`../ari-backend-context/backend-response-to-fe.md` §9](../ari-backend-context/backend-response-to-fe.md). PO/BA can reply either by editing that file directly (one block per OQ) or via the AC-1594 / AC-1439 / AC-1440 Jira threads.
